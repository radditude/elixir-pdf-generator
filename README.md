# elixir-pdf-generator

A wrapper for wkhtmltopdf (HTML to PDF) and PDFTK (adds in encryption) for use
in Elixir projects. If available, it will use xvfb-run (x virtual frame buffer)
to use wkhtmltopdf on systems that have no X installed, e.g. a server.

# New in 0.5.0 - farewell Porcelain, hello chrome-headless (puppeteer)

  - 0.5.0
    - **Got rid of Porcelain** dependency as it interferes with many builds using
      plain `System.cmd/3`. Please note, that as of the documentation
      (https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/System.html#cmd/3) ports will be closed but in
      case wkhtmltopdf somehow hangs, nobody takes care of terminating it.
    - Refactored some sections
    - **Support URLs** instead of just plain HTML
    - **Support for chrome-headless** for (at least for me) faster and nicer renderings.
    - Since this is hopefully helpful, I rose the version to 0.5.0 even tough
      the API stays consistent
  - 0.5.1
    - allow chrome to be executed as root via default config option
      `disable_chrome_sandbox` â€“ this is required for an easy usage within a
      docker container as in
      [elixir-pdf-server](https://github.com/gutschilla/elixir-pdf-server)
  - 0.5.2
    - **BUGFIX** introduced in 0.5.0 when global options to wkhtmltopdf weren't
      accepted any more due to wrong shell parameter order. Thanks to
      [manukall](https://github.com/manukall) for reporting.

For a proper changelog, see [CHANGES](CHANGES.md)

# System prerequisites (either wkhtmltopdf or nodejs and maybe pdftk)

1. Run `npm install`. This requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org), of course.
   This will install a recent chromium and chromedriver to run Chrome in
   headless mode and use this browser and its API to print PDFs.

**OR***

2. Download wkhtmltopdf and place it in your $PATH. Current binaries can be
   found here: http://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
   
   * _(optional)_ To use wkhtmltopdf on systems without an X window server
     installed, please install `xvfb-run` from your repository (on
     Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`).

  * On current (2018) Macintosh computers `/usr/X11/bin/xvfb` should be
    available and is reported to do the same thing. _warning:** This is untested.
    PLS report to me if you ran this successfully on a Mac.

**AND MAYBE**

3. _(optional)_ Install pdftk via your package manager or homebrew. The project
   page also contains a Windows installer

# Usage

Add this to your dependencies in your mix.exs:

    def application do
        [applications: [
            :logger, 
            :pdf_generator # <-- add this
        ]]
    end
    
    defp deps do
        [
            # ... whatever else
            { :pdf_generator, ">=0.5.0" }, # <-- and this
        ]
    end

Then pass some html to PdfGenerator.generate

```
$ iex -S mix

html = "<html><body><p>Hi there!</p></body></html>"
# be aware, this may take a while...
{:ok, filename}    = PdfGenerator.generate(html, page_size: "A5")
{:ok, pdf_content} = File.read(filename) 

# or, if you prefer methods that raise on error:
filename = PdfGenerator.generate!(html, generator: :chrome)
```

Or, pass some URL

```
PdfGenerator.generate {:url, "http://google.com"}, page_size: "A5"
```

Or, use chrome-headless

```
html_works_too = "<html><body><h1>Minimalism!"
{:ok, filename}    = PdfGenerator.generate html_works_too, generator: :chrome
```

Or use the bang-methods:

```
filename   = PdfGenerator.generate! "<html>..."
pdf_binary = PdfGenerator.generate_binary! "<html>..."
```

# Options and Configuration

This module will automatically try to finde both `wkhtmltopdf` and `pdftk` in
your path. But you may override or explicitly set their paths in your
`config/config.exs`. 

```
config :pdf_generator,
    wkhtml_path:    "/usr/bin/wkhtmltopdf",   # <-- this program actually does the heavy lifting
    pdftk_path:     "/usr/bin/pdftk"          # <-- only needed for PDF encryption
```
 
or, if you prefer shrome-headless

```
config :pdf_generator,
    use_chrome: true             # <-- will be default by 0.6.0 
    pdftk_path: "/usr/bin/pdftk" # <-- only needed for PDF encryption
```

## Running wkhtml headless (server-mode)

This section only applies to `wkhtmltopdf` users.

If you want to run `wkhtmltopdf` with an unpatched verison of webkit that requires
an X Window server, but your server (or Mac) does not have one installed,
you may find the `command_prefix` handy:

```
PdfGenerator.generate "<html..", command_prefix: "xvfb-run" 
```

This can also be configured globally in your `config/config.exs`:

```
config :pdf_generator,
    command_prefix: "/usr/bin/xvfb-run"
```

If you will be generating multiple PDFs simultaneously, or in rapid succession,
you will need to configure `xvfb-run` to search for a free X server number,
or set the server number explicitly. You can use the `command_prefix` to pass
options to the `xvfb-run` command.

```
config :pdf_generator,
    command_prefix: ["xvfb-run", "-a"]
```

## More options

- `filename` - filename for the output pdf file (without .pdf extension, defaults to a random string)

- `page_size`:        
  * defaults to `A4`, see `wkhtmltopdf` for more options 
  * A4 will be translated to `page-height 11` and `page-width 8.5` when
    chrome-headless is used

- `open_password`:    requires `pdftk`, set password to encrypt PDFs with

- `edit_password`:    requires `pdftk`, set password for edit permissions on PDF

- `shell_params`:     pass custom parameters to `wkhtmltopdf`. **CAUTION: BEWARE OF SHELL INJECTIONS!** 

- `command_prefix`:   prefix `wkhtmltopdf` with some command or a command with options
                      (e.g. `xvfb-run -a`, `sudo` ..)
                      
- `delete_temporary`: immediately remove temp files after generation

## Heroku Setup

If you want to use this project on heroku, you can use buildpacks instead of binaries
to load `pdftk` and `wkhtmltopdf`:
```
https://github.com/fxtentacle/heroku-pdftk-buildpack
https://github.com/dscout/wkhtmltopdf-buildpack
https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir
https://github.com/gjaldon/phoenix-static-buildpack
```

__note:__ The list also includes Elixir and Phoenix buildpacks to show you that they
must be placed after `pdftk` and `wkhtmltopdf`. It won't work if you load the 
Elixir and Phoenix buildpacks first.
